            <h2>Ayrton Senna da Silva</h2>
            <p>Was a Brazilian racing driver who <strong> won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991.</strong> Senna is one of three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the World Championship and <strong>won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the latter being the record until 2006.</strong> He died in an accident leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix driving for the Williams team.</p>

            <p>Senna was recognised for <strong>his qualifying speed over one lap,</strong> and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. <strong></strong>He  a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix,</strong> is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins and has won more races for McLaren than any other driver. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.</p>
